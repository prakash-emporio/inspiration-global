Everything reliant on cyberspace faces potential risks, including private data, intellectual property, cyber infrastructure, and even military and national security. These risks can emerge from deliberate attacks, inadvertent security lapses, and vulnerabilities in the relatively immature, unregulated global Internet",

Some even question the feasibility of achieving complete security in today's ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats",
