              In today's digital and mobile-centric world, governments and
              public sector organizations must operate in an "Always On" mode.
              People increasingly expect to interact with citizen services on
              their own terms, and they demand digital technology as the means
              to enable these interactions. This involves delivering information
              through the preferred channels selected by citizens, embodying a
              digital-first mindset that empowers agencies and departments to
              serve their staff and citizens whenever, wherever, and however
              they desire.
